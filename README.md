# tamed-mnras
My version of the mnras.bst file to generate a reference list that adheres to the MNRAS instructions (https://academic.oup.com/mnras/pages/general_instructions#6.3%20References%20and%20citations)


### Improvements over existing mnras.bst (v3.0, modified 09 March 2015)
* Removal of undue comma preceding "et al.": e.g. "Cheeseman G., et al., 1986[...]" now changed to "Cheeseman et al., 1986[...]"
* Proper formatting for *arXiv* preprints according to MNRAS recommendations: e.g. "Harryman H., et al., 1984, arXiv e-prints, p. arXiv:2203.11227"  now changed to "Harryman H. et al., 1984, preprint (arXiv:2203.11227)". For *arXiv* preprints, the bibtex entry generated by NASA ADS includes the *arXiv* identifier as a "pages" field. Under mnras.bst, this was printed as a page number (with the prefix "p. "). This is now avoided.
* Ordering of "a/b/c" year-suffixes by month for articles with identical first authors and publication years.
